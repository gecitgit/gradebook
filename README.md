# Gradebook
## A personal project to make the life of a tutor a tad bit easier!

---

## Description
Gradebook is a personal project designed to cater to the needs of private tutors or educators looking for a simplified way to track their students and assignments. In its early stages, the application enables educators to maintain a roster of students and document important information such as student details and assignments.

The core of this application is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It uses Firebase for Authentication, Data Storage in Firestore, and File Storage capabilities. MaterialUI plays a role in certain features, but a lot of the flair comes from custom CSS.

Gradebook is hosted with love on [Vercel](https://gradebook-eight.vercel.app/).
